<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>DerbyRunner is designed to keep track of participants, lane assignments,
and scores in race. It was originally developed for a Cub Scout Pinewood Derby,
but it should be useful for any similar sort of race.  The key assumptions
are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The race involves some sort of vehicle.</li>
    <li>Each vehicle travels in its own lane; lane changes are not allowed.</li>
    <li>The race is scored based on the order in which the vehicles cross
        the finish line, not based on a timer.</li>
</ul>

<p>DerbyRunner manages lane assignments so that each vehicle races once in
each lane, to minimize the bias caused by a "fast" or "slow" lane. It uses
Young and Pope's <a href="http://stanpope.net/ppngen.html">
Partial Perfect-N</a> algorithm to achieve this.</p>

<p>The program manages two sets of data: vehicles and races. Typically you'll
have several different qualifying races with different groups of vehicles, then
a final championship race with the winners from the qualifying races.

<h2>Managing Vehicles</h2>

<p>The "Manage Vehicles" screen lets you enter information about each
vehicle. Each vehicle has an ID, its owner's name, and an optional group
to which it belongs.

<p>The <b>Vehicle ID</b> can be any sort of string, though it
makes sense to keep it short like "001", "002", "Den1Car1", etc. Each vehicle
should have a unique ID.

<p>The <b>Owner's Name</b> is just that -- the name of the vehicle's owner
(or driver, or builder... Whoever is responsible for that vehicle.)

<p>The <b>Group</b> is an optional field and can be anything which might
help categorizing sets of vehicles. You may want to group them by skill
level (Novice, Advanced, Expert), by rank (Wolf, Bear, Webelos), by classroom,
by grade, by age, or any other categorization that makes sense. You can use
anything you want here. DerbyRunner doesn't use groupings directly, but it
does let you sort the vehicles according to group. This can be helpful when
assigning vehicles to races.

<p>Vehicles can be added manually, or imported from a Comma-Separated Values
(CSV) file.  

<p>If you intend to run multiple races, each vehicle needs a single entry.
Vehicles that compete in more than one race still just have a single entry
on the Manage Vehicles screen</p>

<p>All changes made on the Manage Vehicles screen is automatically saved to
disk.</p>
