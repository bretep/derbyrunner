DerbyRunner keeps track of vehicles and scores in a race. I wrote it to keep track of a Cub Scout Pinewood Derby, but it's useful for any similar sort of race where you have a number of lanes and are ranking the winner of each heat as first, second, third, and so on. No support is currently available for races which are scored by timers.

To minimize the advantage of being in a "fast" lane, each vehicle races once in each lane. Young and Pope's [Partial Perfect-N](http://stanpope.net/ppngen.html) algorithm is used for lane assignment.

DerbyRunner runs on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux.
