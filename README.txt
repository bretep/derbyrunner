To make use of the source code you'll need to install Titanium Appcelerator,
available from <http://www.appcelerator.com/>. It's a nice cross-platform
development/runtime environment that lets you use web technologies to build
native apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

The 'DerbyRunner' directory contains the Appcelerator project. Launch the
Titanium Developer app and tell it to import the project. From there
you'll be able to build and package the code.  Titanium Developer is not
an IDE. Use your favorite editor to make source code changes.
